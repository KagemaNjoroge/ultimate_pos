   MIDDLEWARE = [
       # ... other middleware
       "company.middleware.BranchSelectionMiddleware",
   ]
   ```

2. Add context processor to `settings.py`:
   ```python
   TEMPLATES = [{
       'OPTIONS': {
           'context_processors': [
               # ... other processors
               "company.context_processors.current_branch_context",
           ],
       },
   }]
   ```

### URL Configuration

```python
path("select_current_branch/", select_current_branch, name="select_current_branch"),
path("switch_branch/", switch_branch, name="switch_branch"),
```

### JavaScript Usage

```javascript
// Switch branch programmatically
BranchManager.switchBranch(branchId, onSuccess, onError);

// Get current branch
const currentBranch = BranchManager.getCurrentBranch();

// Update branch display
BranchManager.updateBranchDisplay(branchData);
```

### Template Usage

```html
<!-- Display current branch name -->
<span class="current-branch-name">{{ current_branch_name }}</span>

<!-- Branch selector dropdown -->
<div class="branch-selector-dropdown"></div>
```

## Local Storage

```javascript
// Storage key
const storageKey = 'ultimatepos_current_branch';

// Stored data structure
{
    id: 1,
    name: "Main Branch",
    address: "123 Main St",
    phone: "+1234567890",
    timestamp: 1672531200000
